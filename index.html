        <p class="name">
          I am skilled in team management/leadership and IP Networks deployment and configuration, IP/MPLS (Layer 2&3) and IP routing. Moreover, my solid background in customer focus has allowed me to build, lead, and work with teams with exceptional performance. As a holder of Electrical Engineering degree, CCNP and cloud fundamentals, I can competently execute high-level support and rapid resolution to network problems, recommend network modification as well as design and develop LAN/WAN solutions.

          Additionally, I am currently enrolled at Moringa, the school of coding. I am confident the skill will complement my skill set, thus the ability to parse and create a wide array of solutions.
